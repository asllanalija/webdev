				OP.GG is a stat tracker that uses the game's API in order to get information on certain player stats, or champion stats.
				It also analyzes games in order to find trends, such as a certain build having a higher winrate on a certain champion
				than others.

			<div class = "text">
				Pro builds records games from high rank players/pros, and it has a page for each player and each champion. For the champion
				pages, it has the most frequently built items, for example it shows an item is built 87% of the time on a champion, so it can help you know what
				to buy.
