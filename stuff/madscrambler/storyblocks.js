Using your clues and assets, you need to track the Scrambler down and put him away for good.  We don't have much to go on, but there's a rumor that the Scrambler is hitting the Social Community first.  In order to protect your clues from the Scrambler, though, you'll need to keep your clues in a formatted list.  You can keep them as an ordered list or an unordered list.<br /><br />Make a title for the list.  You can put it in an h2 tag and call it Clues.<br /><br />Type the clues in HTML format in your Input Box.  In order to make a list, first create the list using the ol or ul tag for ordered or unorder lists.  Make sure to close your tag when you're done.<br /><br />Each item inside the list needs to be inside of an li tag.  Try typing it into the box and clicking the Send Data button.",clue:"Social Community",nextPage:1},{story:"Great job, Agent Zota.  You go ahead and log into the social community...<br /><br />After hours and hours of going through posts about who ate what for dinner and whose cats are the cutest, you come across this odd pattern or words:  Dillzouble Trillzouble on the Cillzolor Trillzain.  You're pretty sure it's a clue, but you'd better deciper it and add it to your list of clues (hint: clues are case sensitive).", clue:"Double Trouble on the Color Train",  nextPage:2},{story:"The Color Train?  I don't know what that is?  Do you?  You'd better go see Sneaky Rita.  She'll point you in the right direction.  In order to see Sneaky Rita, make a second list.  This will be a list of assets (don't forget to make a title for it).  Add Sneaky Rita to your list of Assets.",clue:"Sneaky Rita",nextPage:3},{story:"Good news!  Sneaky Rita's heard of the Data Bus.  It cost a pretty penny, but she gave us the clue we need.  She said to Cancel Sunny Sue, but something's funny about that clue.  I don't think it'll work the way she said it.",clue:"CSS",nextPage:4},{story:"Of course!  CSS!  The Mad Scrambler has always had some trouble with color.  He can't scramble through orange.  Let's make a new list with some CSS commands (labelled CSS).

Let's add an item that makes the background black.",clue:"background-color:black",nextPage:6},{story:"That's better.  We're protected now, but we still don't know where to find the Mad Scrambler.  Maybe Sneaky Rita told us more than we thought.  Maybe the clue was more than just a warning.  I think there was a coffee house on the other side of town that has a name that's <b><i>similar</i></b> with one of the words in CSS.  Do you remember the name of that coffee house?  If so, add it to the list of clues.",clue:"Cascade",nextPage:7},{story:"That's it!  I guess that's why you get paid the big bucks, Agent Zota.  Here.

The Mad Scrambler is here somewhere.  Plug in that wireless stick and...  Damn it!  You need the wireless key.  If I know the Mad Scrambler, it's right out there for us to find.  He left this trail of clues for us.  The clues themselves are probably a clue.  There are 4 of them...  Each one of them has a first letter...  Those pieces seem relevant...  If you can figure it out, add that clue to our list.",clue:"4SDCC",nextPage:9},{story:"We're in!  I don't know how you figured that one out.  Watch out!  He's about to scramble our lists.  I don't know how he's doing it, but he must have found a way through our orange shield.<br /><br />We're going to need to get clever for this one.  First, put all of your lists into one big list.  That means create an outer ol or ul and then put each of your other lists into an li.  That means the h2, the ol or ul, and all of the li tags encapsulated into a single li and all of those new li tags encapsulated into one ol or ul.
